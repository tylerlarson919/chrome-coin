            <p>
              When I was a little kid, school wasn&apos;t exactly easy for me. I
              was short, quieter, and different enough that it made me a
              target. I&apos;d get picked on in class, shoved in the halls, and
              sometimes I&apos;d just sit there pretending it didn&apos;t
              bother me, but it always did. I didn&apos;t know how to fight
              back, so instead I&apos;d go home and escape into my own world.
            </p>
            <p>
              That world was digital art. I remember the first time I opened up
              a drawing program on my old computerâ€”it felt like a secret door
              nobody else knew about. I could sit there for hours, creating
              characters, little worlds, and scenes that made me feel powerful
              and safe. The bullies couldn&apos;t touch me there.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I got older, art stopped being just an escape and became my
              voice. Every piece I made was like reclaiming the confidence I
              lost in those classrooms and hallways. And even though the
              bullying hurt, I honestly think without it, I wouldn&apos;t have
              pushed myself to create the way I do today.
