              <p>
                When I was a little kid, school wasn&apos;t exactly easy for me. I
                was short, quieter, and different enough that it made me a
                target. I&apos;d get picked on in class, shoved in the halls, and
                sometimes I&apos;d just sit there pretending it didn&apos;t bother me, but
                it always did. I didn&apos;t know how to fight back, so instead I&apos;d
                go home and escape into my own world.
              </p>
              <p>
                That world was digital art. I remember the first time I opened
                up a drawing program on my old computerâ€”it felt like a secret
                door nobody else knew about. I could sit there for hours,
                creating characters, little worlds, and scenes that made me feel
                powerful and safe. The bullies couldn&apos;t touch me there.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I got older, art stopped being just an escape and became my
                voice. Every piece I made was like reclaiming the confidence I
                lost in those classrooms and hallways. And even though the
                bullying hurt, I honestly think without it, I wouldn&apos;t have
                pushed myself to create the way I do today.
